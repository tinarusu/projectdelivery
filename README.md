website page for delivery companies
"Yum Yum Food" website is an easy way to order food, for anyone. It's unique and minimalist design is designed to help everyone place an order in less than 5 minutes. 
The idea of the website is to simplify the people's life ordering food and having a quick access to almost 40 stores registred.
The website is still under maintanance and on the final version the following should be implemented correctly:

- registration of the account
- future registration for companies
-tracking order details
-implementation on Google Maps positions (already on faze 1 with the address of the current location as example)
-payment options
-delivery pop ups update


So far the website presents a variety of good looking images, interactive buttons, and a new position for the "switch button", which will conclude on switching to sea food category instead of dark/light website theme.

-the website presents an easy login setup and also registration option for a normal account
-the website requires a json server to be opened and the integration of POSTMAN 


The testing was made on the switch buttons/ login window/ register and contact window. All buttons work and the user is capable of pressint/ inserting numbers and texts.
